This is a fully functional example calculation for TINKTEP -- a QM/MM 
interface for ONETEP and TINKER.

The example is a water dimer calculation, where one of the water molecules
is in the QM subsystem, and the other water molecule is in the MM subsystem.
The model is TINKTEP2 (with MM repulsive potential). There is mutual,
fully self-consistent polarisation between QM and MM. 

To run the calculation:
1. Obtain a copy of TINKER v7.0. This should be available at no cost from 
   Jay Ponder's website. It is imperative that you use v7.0 or else the 
   patches supplied with ONETEP will not work.
2. Patch your copy of TINKER using the set of patches located in 
   utils/tinktep/tinktep_patches. Make sure they all applied correctly.
3. Compile and install your patched copy of TINKER.
4. Ensure that at least the following executables from the TINKER suite 
   can be found in your PATH: analyze, dynamic, poledit.
5. Compile ONETEP v4.5.18.8 or later.
6. Ensure all scripts supplied in utils/tinktep can be found in your PATH.
7. Copy your ONETEP executable to "onetep.exe" in this directory.
8. Copy amoeba09.prm (provided by your TINKER distrib'n) to this directory.
9. Type "tinktep" and hit enter.

The calculation should complete in under an hour on a desktop machine.
It should converge in 29 NGWF iterations (quite a lot, because of the 
steepness of the MM repulsive potential).
