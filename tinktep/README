==========================================================================
This directory contains script files and an example config file
for TINKTEP -- the QM/MM interface for ONETEP and TINKER.

Also provided are patches that can be applied to a copy of TINKER
(not distributed here) to make it compatible with TINKTEP.

Also provided is a full working example for a QM/MM calculation.

This functionality is work in progress and no support is offered
at this time. It also requires a customised copy of TINKER to run
correctly, so it is unlikely to be usable to you at the moment.
